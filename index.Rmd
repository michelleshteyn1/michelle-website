I am a Ph.D. candidate with 6+ years of experience conducting quantitative and qualitative research in laboratory, field, and online settings. I am passionate about harnessing psychological science to address socially significant issues like climate change and public health. In my free time, I love doing yoga, trying out new recipes, and biking the Pacific coast.
